## Task

In this competition, you'll use natural language processing (NLP) to automate the discovery of how scientific data are referenced in publications. 

Utilizing the full text of scientific publications from numerous research areas gathered from CHORUS publisher members and other sources, you'll identify data sets that the publications' authors used in their work.

The objective of the competition is to identify the mention of datasets within scientific publications. 

Your predictions will be short excerpts from the publications that appear to note a dataset.
